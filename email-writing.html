Dear Dr. Watson,

After reviewing my notes on your lecture about X last week, I still have some questions about it. I'm specifically confused about...

Would it be possible to schedule an appointment sometime this week to go over it? I'm available Wednesday and Friday afternoon this week.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Dear Professor Schrute,

I am having a problem with the financial report I'm working on, which is due in two weeks. I've already completed the forecasting portion, but I am not sure what should be included in the investment summary.

Attached is my investment summary draft and the related worksheet. I was wondering if you could take a look at it if you have the time and give me some suggestions. I would really appreciate it.

Thank you.

Best,
Phoebe Buffay</p>
