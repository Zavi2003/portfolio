    <h1>Research Writing</h1>
    <h2>Background of the Study</h2>
    <p>Language policy management in Sri Lanka remains a critical and complex issue, particularly within its multilingual society. The educational sector, especially higher education, is a primary domain where these policies are implemented, with significant implications for academic access, equity, and success.</p>

    <h2>Research Problem</h2>
    <p>This study addresses the impact of language policies on student learning within Sri Lankan state universities. Despite established policies, there is a need to examine their practical implementation and consequences on the academic experiences and outcomes of students in a linguistically diverse academic environment.</p>

    <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
    <p>The primary objective of this research is to investigate the implementation of language planning and policy within the higher education context, with a specific focus on the Faculty of Management and Finance at the University of Ruhuna.</p>

    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>Existing literature has extensively examined language policies in educational settings, highlighting their profound influence on student learning, identity, and inclusion. Previous studies provide a foundation for understanding the broader theoretical and global context, into which this research aims to insert a specific, localized case study.</p>

    <h2>Significance of the Study</h2>
    <p>This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how language policies translate into practice and affect educational outcomes in a multilingual state university setting. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and administrators aiming to enhance equity and effectiveness in higher education language planning.</p>
